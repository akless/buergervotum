# we together - wir zusammen

With this project we as a democratic civilisation want to find out: <br>
A) What is it, we agree on? <br>
B) What is it, we don't agree on?<br>
<br>
We do this through a simple app. We post yes-or-no questions that the community answers.
<br> <br> 
The more people use the app the more the results can be used to benchmark politics on what the people actually want. 

That way we can faciliate the acutalization of the goal of a democratic society: To foster justice and well-being equally for every citizen.
