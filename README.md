# BÃ¼rgervotum: we together - wir zusammen

With this project we as a democratic civilization want to find out: <br>
A) What is it, we agree on? <br>
B) What is it, we don't agree on?<br>
<br>
We do this through a simple app. We post yes-or-no questions that the community answers.
<br> <br> 
The more people use the app the more the results can be used to benchmark politics on what the people actually want. 

That way we can faciliate the acutalization of the goal of a democratic society: To foster justice and well-being equally for every citizen.

<b>Check the dummy here (in German):</b>

<br><br>


<b>Explanation:</b><br>
Green hook -> "Yes"<br>
Blue question mark -> "don't know" <br>
red cross -> "No"<br>
grey star -> "important"  <br>
<br>
If one finds a question important, the star needs to be clicked first.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Planned changes for a more final version:</b>
- new design
- "Yes"&"No" to be swipeable as in Tinder and similiar apps
- no "don't know"-button; instead a "skip"-button
- a results dashboard sorting the questions into a) most important b) most clicked c) high degree of of approval d) low degree of approval
- verified user accounts to prevent doubled answers and enable representative results through demogrpahic data
- better engagement algorithm to decide, what question comes next, in order to keep the users hooked
